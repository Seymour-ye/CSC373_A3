# CircleMST

 - how you coded the algorithm

 - a table showing the runtime and output 
 
| V  | Runtime |Output |
| ------------- | ------------- |------------- |
| 10  | 0.00628571428571429 |3.30203985459435|
| 100  | 0.0131428571428571  | 3.93298527879717|  
| 1000  | 0.148571428571429  | 3.70289823919542 |
| 10000 | 10.9747142857143  | 3.78338108948945 |

 - how the result varies with V
 
 As the weight of MST increased, the runtime increased as well, but the output is around the same.
 As shown above, the Runtime is increasing sharply from 2 times to the previous one to around 80 times to the previous one, but the Output is always around 3.5

 As the weight of MST increased, the runtime increased as well, but the output is around the same.
 As shown above, the Runtime is increasing sharply from 2 times to the previous one to around 20 times to the previous one, but the Output is always around 1.2
